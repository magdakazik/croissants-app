# croissants-app
A challenge task.

PLEASE READ ME!

1. To start working with my app, you need to download the code, extract it, then open cmd, navigate to your extracted folder and run _npm install_ command.
2. After the packages were installed, run _npm start_ command to start the development server and localhost. Wait for the server to start and a new browser tab will be opened.
3. By default, you will see the "403 FORBIDDEN" error message as you are not logged in. Please use following credentials: _username: admin_, _password: admin_.
4. Now you can modify your cart by adding some delicious croissants into it :)
